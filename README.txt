
This fold includes code that generate main results in the article entitled "A copula-based framework for emergent constraints using MCMC simulations"

1. System requirements
R (4.4.1) and RStudio (2024.09.1) are required to run the code.

2. Installation guide
Please open the file of "Project.Rproj" using RStudio.

3. Instruction
Here we provide source code and data that are necessary to generate figures in the main text. Please run the code in "code" folder with the following order: 
-- 0. library.R
-- 11. Marginal and joint distributions.R
-- 12. EC using a single metric.R
-- 13. HEC and MCMC.R
-- 21. EC using Vine Copula.R
-- 22. Plot relationships in EC.R
-- 23. Plot Vine Copula.R

4. Notes
4.1. Before running our code, please make sure that all packages specified in the "0. library.r" have been installed.
4.2. If you are only interested to copula-based processes, please read the "12. EC using a single metric.R" and "21. EC using Vine Copula.R" files. 
4.3. All the figures will be saved to the folder "Figures/Final Figures/"
