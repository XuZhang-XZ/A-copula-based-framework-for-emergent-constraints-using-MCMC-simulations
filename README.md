This fold includes codes that generate main results in the article entitled "A copula-based framework for emergent constraints using MCMC simulations"

## 1. System requirements
R (4.4.1) and RStudio (2024.09.1) are required to run the code.

## 2. Installation guide
Please download and unzip the "Code_JCLI-D-24-0591_20250405.zip" file. Then, open the file of "Project.Rproj" using RStudio.

-- 0. library.R\
-- 11. Fig.1.R\
-- 12. Fig.2.R\
-- 13. Fig.3.R\
-- 14. Fig.4.R\
-- 15. Fig.5.R\
-- 16. Fig.6.R\
-- 17. Fig.7.R\
-- 18. Fig.8.R

## 4. Notes
4.1. Before running our code, please make sure that all packages specified in the "0. library.R" have been installed.\
4.2. All figures will be saved to the "Figures" folder.\
