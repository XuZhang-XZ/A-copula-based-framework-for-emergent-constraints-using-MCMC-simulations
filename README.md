# A-copula-based-framework-for-emergent-constraints-using-MCMC-simulations

This fold includes code that generate main results in the article entitled "A copula-based framework for emergent constraints using MCMC simulations"

## 1. System requirements
R (4.4.1) and RStudio (2024.09.1) are required to run the code.

## 2. Installation guide
Please download and unzip the "Code_JCLI-D-24-0591_20250103.zip" file. Then, open the file of "Project.Rproj" using RStudio.

## 3. Instruction
Here we provide source code and data that are necessary to generate figures in the main text. Please run the code in "code" folder with the following order: \
-- 0. library.R \
-- 11. Marginal and joint distributions.R\
-- 12. EC using a single metric.R\
-- 13. HEC and MCMC.R\
-- 21. EC using Vine Copula.R\
-- 22. Plot relationships in EC.R\
-- 23. Plot Vine Copula.R

## 4. Notes
4.1. Before running our code, please make sure that all packages specified in the "0. library.R" have been installed.\
4.2. All the figures will be saved to the "Figures/Final Figures/" folder.\
